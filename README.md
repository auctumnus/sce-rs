# sce-rs

Rust implementation of [SCE]. Intended to be compatible with
[the current python implementation] and its [documentation][py-docs].

## Usage

From Rust code:

```sh
$ cargo install sce
```

The CLI isn't made yet, but eventually this should be possible.

WASM is also planned.

## License

[NVPLv7+]; however, the codebase that this is nominally a port of is [MIT]
(along with the [newer codebase] and [its license]).
